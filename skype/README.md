We assume that all numbers in ldap
are beginning with a '0' and are 10 digits long

```
For example :

07-12-34-56-78
mobile_phone = 03,12,34,56,78

```

This script will write in file
all numbers formated for skypebeeper

Be aware that numbers will be formatted as french mobile numbers  
Hence they will be prefixed by +33  
You may want to replace by your country prefix  

If this is the case,  
Just update the +33 in sed call in line 5

Use ./loginmobile.sh loginfile.txt outputfile.txt
